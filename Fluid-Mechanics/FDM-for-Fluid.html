    <h3>Notes: Finite Difference Method for Fluid Mechanics</h3>

    <h4>Equations for 2D Eulerian Incompressible/Compressible Fluid Flow</h4>

        <p>It is worth mentioning that a buoyancy term can by added to the momentum equations, take the incompressible flow
        for example: </p>
        <p class="blank-5"><img src="FDM-for-Fluid/buoyancy-equation-incompressible.jpg" height="200" width="400"></p>
        <p>the buoyancy is caused by a small changes in density, and this term can be solved explicitly.</p>

    <h4>Stable Conditions</h4>
        <p>There are two stable conditions must to be satisfied for an explicit FDM procedure: </p>

    <h4>Explicit and Implicit</h4>
        <h5>For incompressible flow (Euler method)</h5>
        <p>To solve the momentum equations of a 2D incompressible fluid flow, a method that combines both explicit and
        implicit techniques is preferred, because of a stability condition that is present in the pressure term in the
        momentum equation.</p>
        <p>For an ADIABATIC system, the sound speed can be expressed as</p>
        <p class="blank-5">c^2 = dp/dρ</p>
        <p>for an incompressible flow, ρ is constant thus dρ→∞, but p is not constant, which leads c^2→∞. The Courant
        condition states that</p>
        <p class="blank-5">(|u|+c)dt/dx < 1</p>
        <p>indicating that the system will be <strong>unstable if pressures are computed explicitly.</strong></p>
        <p>While the pressure contributions to momentum equations must be computed implicitly, then, the rest of the terms
        can be computed faster using an explicit method.</p>
        <h5>For compressible flow</h5>
        <p>For compressible flow, as the sound speed is not infinite, explicit method can be used for pressure term, with
        Courant condition and Diffusion condition satisfied conditionally.</p>


    <h4>Donor-cell and cell-centered technique</h4>
        <h5>For 2D incompressible flow (Euler method)</h5>
        <p>In the momentum equations, the advective terms can be calculated using either a donor-cell or cell-centered
        technique.</p>
        <p>A cell-centered approach is allowable because the viscous terms prevents numerical instability, this approach
        results in a code that is able to resolve <strong>delicate</strong> physical phenomena that occur at <strong>
        low viscosity</strong>, such as the KARMAN VORTEX STREET.</p>
        <p>Use of the donor-cell technique results in a code that is able to handle more <strong>violent</strong>
        phenomena, such as the rushing of fluid over a stationary block. It allows for systems at higher velocities
        and with more change in velocities to be simulated without becoming numerical unstable, but loses much of
        the precision of the cell-centered technique.</p>
